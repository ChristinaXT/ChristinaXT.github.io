There are many reasons I am interested in Web and software development.  I find it fascinating.  I actually love the mystery of how the codes work together and what the final product will look like.  I have been writing creatively my entire life and coding seems to tickle the same part of my brain.  I actually look forward to learning more about software development and have come to realize that I will not become tired of the tasks put ahead of me.  I truly believe I will love the software development world and it will fit perfectly into my life.

On a practical side, I am about to become a new mom and need to work remotely.  I also, write plays and coding on a professional level will allow me to pursue my creative endeavors more freely.

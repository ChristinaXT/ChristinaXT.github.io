I was really excited about creating my final project with Flatiron School. I read all the suggested blogs and helper materials teaching you how to get started building your app.

https://www.contentful.com/blog/2019/02/18/how-build-react-redux-app/ - This one and the tutorial videos Howard Created with the Globetrotters were the most helpful.

I decided to create an app to build story ideas since I write plays and thought it would be fun as like a play or screen writing prompt app. The idea is to be able to enter information like the character names, given circumstances, the setting, time period and synopsis. etc.

I created the rails backend first with the controllers, models and then serializers. At first, I overdid the number of controllers and models and then cut them down to bare bones to make it less complicated.

Then I created the client - added the frontend to the same repository. (The instructions for this are on the two tutorials suggested on the project page. Howard's tutorial videos show you how to do the frontend and backend on two different repositories.

I chose the components, reducers and actions following the tutorial videos and applying the suggestions to what my project needed. 

It took a lot of trouble shooting before I got my project to work correctly, but when it finally did, I embraced the CSS styling and had fun with it.

I can't say this project helped me review everything I had learned so far. I felt like it was its separate beast, but it definitely did teach me how to relate all the little parts together to one big outcome.

Hi! So I really, really like Sinatra, Active Record, migrations, and building forms. It is super fun and I had fun doing this project. I am finally starting to feel like I can do this. I mean, the language is starting to resonate and I am getting things and remembering and not having to look everything up while trying to create code. 

For this project, I started by watching the reference videos provided by Avi. I also had just worked very hard and was proud of my Ftwitter lab and since the two have similar requirements, I was able to build on a lot of code I had already written. I had to add the buttons and more routes since this required creating a type of list that could be edited and deleted.

My project is working, but it could be better. I want to get through the course, so I am moving on, but I definitely will go back when I have time and really make this project look special with some design elements.

thank you Flatiron for making me feel like a much stronger and capable developer after this project.

Also, if you are nervous, just remember that everyone who is in web development was once in the same position. I tell myself that and it pushes me forward and I am confident I can do this.
